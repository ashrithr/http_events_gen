Generating Data:
----------------
To generate HTTP log evnets follow the instructions below:

simulate web requests and log them to `/var/log/mock_apache.log` at a rate of 30 events/sec
  

* Using Ruby:
    
  ```bash
  ruby random_log_gen.rb --file /var/log/mock_apache.log --quantity 30
  ```

* Using Scala:
    
    * Optionally to install Java and Scala (requires sudo privileges)
  
    ```bash
    bash <(curl -s https://raw.github.com/ashrithr/scripts/master/install_puppet_standalone.sh)
    cd ~ && mkdir modules
    cd ~/modules && git clone https://github.com/ashrithr/puppet_java.git java
    cd ~/modules && git clone https://github.com/ashrithr/puppet_scala.git scala
    puppet apply --modulepath=/root/modules/ -e "include java"
    puppet apply --modulepath=/root/modules/ -e "include scala"
    ```
    
  ```bash
  chmod +x RandomHttpLogGen.scala
  ./RandomHttpLogGen.scala /var/log/mock_apache.log 30
  ```
